/*
Divide and conquer algorithm
Recursive algorithm
Uses a pivot element to partition the array into two parts
Elements<pivot to its left, elements>pivot to its right
Pivot will then be its correct-sorted position
Process is now repeated for the left array and right array
Eventually, every element has been the pivot, so every element will be in its correct sorted position
As with merge sort, we'll end up partitioning the array into a series of 1-element arrays
Does this in place(unlike merge sort) and no temp arrays
- In-place algorithm
- O(n log(n))- base-2
- Unstable algorithm
